  * ### [Face Detection](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Face-Detection):
       The objective is to detect object of interest (face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object. In this project, I applied face detection using OpenCV with Python. OpenCV is an open source software library that allows developers to access routine in API (Application Programming Interface) used for computer vision applications.
  * ### [Real-Time Edge Detection](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Real-Time-Edge-Detection):
       The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of images in real-time. The popular canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size(min value and max value) as last two arguments.
       
  * ### [Snapchat Filter](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Snapchat-Filter):
       In this project, I have made a Snapchat filter using OpenCV in Python.
